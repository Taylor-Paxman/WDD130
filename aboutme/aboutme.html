        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Hi Everyone, I am originally from AnnArbor Michigan but I live
                with my wife Makayla and 1 year old daughter Carter in Fruit Heights
                Utah. If you don't know where that is its north salt lake about 20 mins.
                We also have a 2 year old Australian Shepherd named Tucker. If you so
                feel inclined, You can check him out on <a
                    href="https://www.instagram.com/living_with_tucker/">Instagram</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                I have LOVED spending time watching my daughter grow up. I am
                doing my internship BYUI Pathways World Wide as a Data Analyst as well
                as taking a full load of classes while my wife works. I know I am taking on way to much, but this will
                allow
                me to be done with school this year. My wife works as a Data engineer for overstock. She has been there
                for
                2 years and loves it.
                Currently carter is a little walk monster
                who loves to get into everything. Such an active age. Becoming a father has been so Amazing however
                since
                she is walking now we had to hire a Full time Nanny because it has been impossible to get things done.
                Literally impossible.

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>
                Some other things I have really enjoyed doing recently is going to the gym,
                playing basketball, as well as Remodeling our house. Actually Scratch the Baseketball thing. I tore my
                ACL and menicus and had surgery 5 weeks ago. I am doing PT agressivly but have been told it will take
                8-12
                months for full recovery.

            <h2> Home Projects</h2>
            <p>
                As for the home remodeling we just recently
                removed a load bearing wall in our kitchen which has really opened up our
                place. It's been so exciting. Below you can see a small video of the wall before we had it removed.

            <p>
                We have a few other projects to do and I
                am looking forward to that.Â On top of the interior projects I have been doing a lot outside as well.
                You can see a before and after video of the
                Waterfeature and landscape that I personally built.

                Since it was built, I have done other things to it as well and have included below
                the most current video. I love how it has turned out and think the lights make it look so relaxing and
                majestic.

            <h2> Education</h2>
            <p>
                I am studying Data science and I am a Senior in school. This is my
                last semester before I graduate. I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
                My wife also Graduated in the same degree which is why I made the switch over from business. I am so
                happy
                to be finished and Look forward to the future as well as this class.
            </p>

                Anyways, I am very open for anyone who would love to create a Study
                group in this class. Since my schedule is so busy, reach out to me via email : pax12002@byui.edu or by
