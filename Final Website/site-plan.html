      <h2>Style Guide</h2>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/cbc5ea-73628a-313d5a-d4d6b9-f3f9d2"
        target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/cbc5ea-73628a-313d5a-d4d6b9-f3f9d2</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">[#D4D6B9]</td>
          <td class="secondary">[#F3F9D2]</td>
          <td class="accent1">[#CBC5EA]</td>
          <td class="accent2">[#313D5A</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: ["Trirong",serif], [<link
          rel="stylesheet"
          href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Trirong"
        />]
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        I went with googles Trirong font because I think it is the perfect mix
        of a Hard bold font yet comes across as soft. I also think that it is
        Easy to read it is. I want the headings and links to stand out on my
        page. I also want things to be really easy to understand on my page as
        well.
        <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: ["Libre Baskerville", Georgia, serif;]
        <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        [So The reason that I picked this font is I actually went to check what
        a good font was for blogs and this was one that came up. I like the look
        and I think if it is a common font for blogs that most people use there
        is a reason for it. I think it looks classy and will really draw the
        user in.]

      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
